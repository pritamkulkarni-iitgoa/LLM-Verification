    "## üîÑ Workflow Overview: From Data to Cost Estimation\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook follows a structured pipeline to preprocess the benchmark data and estimate the total evaluation cost using an LLM. Here's an overview of the major steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. üì¶ Data Preprocessing\n",
    "- Unzip and load the provided benchmark dataset.\n",
    "- Parse and extract relevant information such as question text, source code, and mutant variants.\n",
    "- Organize the data into structured mappings for easy access during prompt construction.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. üß¨ Source‚ÄìMutant Mapping\n",
    "- Identify and map **original source programs** to their corresponding **mutants**.\n",
    "- Ensure proper alignment between source and mutated code for consistent evaluation.\n",
    "- Filter or clean mappings if needed (e.g., to remove duplicates or invalid samples).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. ‚úèÔ∏è Prompt Construction\n",
    "- Generate evaluation prompts using both the **source** and **mutant** code.\n",
    "- Follow a consistent prompt template to ensure fair comparison across examples.\n",
    "- Handle few-shot or zero-shot formatting if required by the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. üî¢ Token Counting\n",
    "- Calculate the number of tokens per prompt and completion using the target LLM‚Äôs tokenizer.\n",
    "- Aggregate token counts to compute total tokens for all examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. üí∏ Cost Estimation\n",
    "- Multiply total tokens by the **LLM pricing rate** (e.g., cost per 1,000 tokens).\n",
    "- Separate costs for different models (e.g., GPT-4 vs. GPT-3.5) if applicable.\n",
    "- Provide breakdown of token and cost statistics across the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "This step-by-step process ensures accurate cost estimation while maintaining transparency in how data is transformed and fed into the language model.\n"
